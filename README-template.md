# Mortgage Calculator Documentation

## Overview
A mortgage calculator application that allows users to calculate their mortgage payments with an intuitive interface and responsive design.

---

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- Calculate monthly and total repayment amounts by inputting mortgage details.
- See validation messages when fields are incomplete.
- Navigate and complete the form using keyboard only.
- Experience a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- See visual feedback through hover and focus states on interactive elements.
